# Download-D-Compiler-Windows-10
[Automation] Batch script that downloads, extracts and launches D Compiler on Windows 10 or Windows 11

This is not a DMD compiler installer.  
But probably will do the same things in the future.  

The reason of the project:  
The original installer of DMD does not support command line options.     
I've got tired of clicking through the installer's wizard buttons.  
Note: The original installer is little more than an archive extraction.  


This script does not add the compiler to PATH environment variable.  
`add_to_path.cmd` can be used to add a folder to PATH.  (Requires Administrator Privilegies)  


This project is here to provide DMD Compiler on Windows 10 and 11 operating systems flawlessly.
